"# number-guessing v. 1.1.0" 
This program takes your input and compares it to a random number between 1 and 3
If your answer is correct, it will show a congratulations message
If the guessed number does not match, it will show the random number.

Notes: This program requires an external module called "inquirer" to get input from you. Before testing this program, download
inquirer via command line using npm i inquirer.

Updates will come soon.
